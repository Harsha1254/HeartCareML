HeartCare ML: Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

📌 Project Description

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are among the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early prediction of heart-related issues can help in taking preventive measures. HeartCare ML is a machine learning project that analyzes patient health metrics to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease. This project utilizes a structured dataset with various health parameters and applies multiple machine learning techniques to build an accurate prediction model.
